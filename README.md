Program Overview:

The Deep Learning Nanodegree program offers a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence. This program is created to help students master deep learning fundamentals that will prepare you to launch or advance a career, and additionally pursue further advanced studies in the field of artificial intelligence. 

Topics includes neural, convolutional, recurrent neural, and generative adversarial networks, as well as reinforcement learning. Projects are buit in Keras and NumPy and TensorFlow. For anyone interested in building expertise with this transformational technology, this Nanodegree program is an ideal point-of-entry. 

## Projects

[<h2>First Neural Network</h2>](https://github.com/thienan092/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/First%20Neural%20Network)

<h4>Description: </h4>
<p>
This is my first project on Jupyter Notebook. By this project, I built a neural network from scratch to predict hourly bike rental ridership. 

* Data set: The two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data.

[<h2>Dog Breed Identification</h2>](https://github.com/thienan092/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/Dog%20Project)

<h4>Description: </h4>
<p>
This is my first project using Keras' API. I built my first CNN network and applied transfer learning to solve dog identification problem. I got my hand dirty playing with bottleneck features of many CNN architectures such as VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception and Xception.
</p>

[<h2>TV Script Generation</h2>](https://github.com/thienan092/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/TV%20Script%20Generation)

<h4>Description: </h4>
<p>
This is my first RNN network (i.e, LSTM network) implemented by using Tensorflow library. The LSTM network is trained on part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons (less than a megabyte of text). Techniques can be mentioned are creating lookup table, tokenize punctuation for data wrangling, skip-gram version of Word2Vec algorithm, drop-out regularization method, ... for improving LSTM network's performance.
</p>

[<h2>Face Generation</h2>](https://github.com/thienan092/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/Face%20Generation)

<h4>Description: </h4>
<p>
In this project, I used classic fully connected layers and CNN layers to implement GANs on MNIST and CelebA, respectively. By using batch normalization and input normalization, drop-out regularization, ... methods the performance of the network is improved, so, the generated images look like realistic images.

[<h2>Deep RL Quadcopter Controller</h2>](https://github.com/thienan092/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/RL%20Quadcopter)

<h4>Description: </h4>
<p>
This project is my capstone project of Deep Learning NanoDegree.

In this project, I used Deterministic Policy Gradient (a Policy-Based algorithm) to train a virtual quadcopter to fly from a initial position then hover around a target position in a determined duration. Techniques support this algorithm to improve its performance are Prioritized Experience Replay Buffer, 1D Convolutional Layers (it helps the model can capture temporal constraints), ...
